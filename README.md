# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensions - Migrated Sales Order Data
This repository contains the sample code for the [Migrated Sales Order Data tutorial](https://tiny.cc/s4-migrate-historic-data).

*This code is only one part of the tutorial, so please follow the tutorial before attempting to use this code.*

## Description

The [Migrated Sales Order Data tutorial](https://tiny.cc/s4-migrate-historic-data) showcases an extension to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. The scenario contains a simple sales order UI app that displays historical data of sales orders and other documents that have been migrated from a legacy system to another database system. This app allows you to perform search, filter, and sort operations on the data. Additionally, you can export the data to a Microsoft Excel file. A user with the admin role can also import historical sales order data using the import functionality.

At the heart of SAP Extensibility Explorer, there is a rich repository of sample scenarios which show, in a hands-on way, how to realize an extensibility requirement leveraging different extensibility patterns.
